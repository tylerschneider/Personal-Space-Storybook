[The scene fades from white. The professor pops up a bit further ahead, and the chosen dragon
and boy appear at friend distance slightly behind you.]
Professor: Now kids, do you know why we befriend Dragonkin?
[The boy looks confused.]
Boy: Weeeell… No actually… Why do we befriend them, professor?
[The professor responds, smiling.]
Professor: Well come back over here and I’ll tell you!
[A guidance circle appears below the professor without any rings highlighted. When the player
enters the stranger/acquaintance range, the professor will continue.]
Professor: We befriend Dragonkin so that we can travel around the world and meet all kinds of
new people safely. Are you kids ready to head out and see the world with your scaled friends?
[The boy excitedly responds.]
Boy: Yeah!!! Let’s see all kinds of people and places!
Professor: Just don’t forget to tell your mother you’re leaving.
[The professor says chuckling, and the scene fades to white.]
