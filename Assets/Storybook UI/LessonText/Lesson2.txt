Friend: Hey friendo! You on your way to meet Professor Pineapple and pick your Dragonkin?

[The boy’s eyes light up excitedly.]
Friend: I already know which one I want! Come a little closer so I can tell you.
[A guidance circle appears around the boy with the friend ring highlighted. When the player
enters the appropriate range, the dialogue continues.]
Friend: You see, I really want the aqua type, Fina! But let’s hurry on to the lab, pal, we really
wouldn’t want to miss out on choosing!
