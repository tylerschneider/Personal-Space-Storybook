[The scene fades from black. The professor pops up to the side of the player at
stranger/acquaintance distance, the boy pops up slightly behind the player at friend distance,
and three small dragon-like creatures appears further ahead.]
Professor: Now young one, go ahead and pick your Dragonkin! Your friend will pick after you.
[The boy sighs disappointedly.]
Professor: We have Graggle the terra type, Fina the aqua type, and Chindin the pyro type. Go
ahead and pick you new friend.
[A guidance circle appears below each of the dragons without any rings highlighted. When the
player enters the friend range of one of the dragons, the professor will continue.]
Professor: Ah, so youâ€™ve picked [dragon name]? Excellent choice young one! I bet you two will
become the best of friends.
[The scene fades to white.]
